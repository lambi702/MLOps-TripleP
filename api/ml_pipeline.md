# Machine Learning Pipeline and Cloud Storage Integration

## Overview

The MLOps-TripleP project utilizes an advanced machine learning pipeline, leveraging cloud storage specifically for storing prediction outputs. This selective use of cloud storage ensures that predictive data is centrally managed and accessible, enhancing data availability and security while maintaining local control over training datasets.

## Data Processing and Management

### Local Storage for Training Data

Training data are maintained locally, which provides faster access and control during the model training phase. This setup ensures that sensitive or large datasets do not incur unnecessary network latency or security risks associated with external storage solutions.

### Cloud Storage for Predictions

The predictions generated by the machine learning model are stored in the cloud, facilitating:
- Centralized management of predictive outputs.
- Easy access to predictions for further analysis and integration into downstream applications or reporting tools.

## Script Details

### `define_api_data.py`

This script is responsible for preprocessing locally stored training data:
- Performs data cleaning and transformation to prepare it for effective model training.

### `updateTrain.py`

This script manages the interaction with cloud storage and updates to the model:
- Processes new data and updates the training datasets locally.
- Retrains the model with the updated datasets.
- Once predictions are generated, it pushes these results to cloud storage for accessibility and further use.

## Conclusion

The integration of local and cloud storage in the MLOps-TripleP project's ML pipeline offers a balanced approach to data management. By keeping training data local for security and performance, and using cloud storage for predictions, the project optimizes both data handling and computational efficiency.
